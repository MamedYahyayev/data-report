1. Redirect to Shared Project Frame after sharing a project publicly.

2. Create an enum for shared flag arguments between clients and server.
Example:
FLAG_PROJECT(flag_short, flag_long)
FLAG_SERVER_PORT(flag_short, null)

3. The Server has to check the existence of the given project, if the project doesn't exist, then it must
throw exception.

[22-04-2024T13:44:28] jack-task#12 assigned to jack
[22-04-2024T13:56:32] jack completed jack-task#12 in 5:04 minutes
