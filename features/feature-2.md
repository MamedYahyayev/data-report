The feature allows users to do conditional search over scraped data. It is very beneficial to users to stay in the 
program and no need to use any programming language to search or filter data. SQL language will be integrated into 
the system because of popularity and well known by most of the people. However, it will provide additional features
in the future.

## Desired Result

```txt
  select * from cars
    where price > 30000
```

Select query will be only supported SQL query at that time when the feature is implemented on the system.
