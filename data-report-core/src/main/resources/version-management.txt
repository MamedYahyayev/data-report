Version 1.0.1
- Disable Selenium logging ✅
- Write test methods for platform specific ✅
- Change windows specific path into platform independent path ✅
- Problem: Shifted Values ✅
Description:
When fetching from the website, there are some empty values for fields, empty values are ignored and row values
are shifted above. That leads to incorrect values for rows.
Problem happens because of the Selenium fetching, if there is no selector for it, Selenium ignore them.

Solution:
Direct fetching avoided. In order to get all elements in the list, firstly all list elements need to fetch.
Then child elements can be obtained from the parent elements. There is a possibility that some child elements cannot be existed for
particular parent element. Problem fixed by adding new layer called DataParent

Some arguments
    - config file path
    - report file output path

- Deploy jar file to nexus
- Change class, method, file, folder names
- Add package-info to every package and describe what the package includes and used for what ✅
- Move classes, interfaces of the parser package into relevant packages
- Restrict accessibility of the classes
- Complete todos
- Test following conditions
    - Check calling other dependencies main method from the demo application
    - Observe other codes
- Write Recursive methods for scraping and abstract syntax tree
- Write shell scripts to execute plugins or define maven profiles

Next Versions Ideas
- private int inheritanceLevel;
- provide flags for terminal operations

Add execution lifecycle phases to plugins


Add readme file
if possible change the group id and artifact id
do this in separate branch
Write some shell scripts for testing, pmd, javadoc and so on.
