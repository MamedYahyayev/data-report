Description:
When fetching from the website, there are some empty values for fields, empty values are ignored and row values
are shifted above. That leads to incorrect values for rows.
Problem happens because of the Selenium fetching, if there is no selector for it, Selenium ignore them.

Solution:
Direct fetching avoided. In order to get all elements in the list, firstly all list elements need to fetch.
Then child elements can be obtained from the parent elements. There is a possibility that some child elements cannot be existed for
particular parent element. Problem fixed by adding new layer called DataParent

New config file structure

 ---- parent
        |
        ---- selector for parent -
        ---- children
                |

                ---- selector
